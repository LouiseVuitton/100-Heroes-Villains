This is a Python project for Code Louisville Winter 2018. I took the data from American Film Institute's list of 100 Heroes and Villains. The data includes heroes, villains, the actors who played the characters, films, and film release dates. 

The scatter chart is represents all heroes and villains on  the list arranged by year of film release. In the future, I want to add the information about each character on the list. I also want to make graphs showing all the films by year, genre, and Rotten Tomatoes scores.
